# CarpetPlugin

Carpets can also be made of Paper!  
A bukkit plugin aims to implement as many features as [fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) does.  
This is the [Paper](http://papermc.io/) version of Carpet Mod, for Minecraft 1.16.2.  
For Fabric version check [gnembon/fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)  

## Compatibility
Currently, it is only compatible with `v1_16_R2` (1.16.2) with Paper or its fork

Backward and forward support is extremely difficult, and I won't do that.

## Implemented features
- /player ... spawn (carpet.player.spawn) (carpet.player.spawn.whitelist)
- /player ... kill (carpet.player.kill)

## Copyright notice
Most of the logics of this plugin comes from [fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)
